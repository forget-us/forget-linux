`du': Estimate file space usage
du reports the amount of disk space used by the specified files and
for each subdirectory (of directory arguments).

Synopsis:
       du [OPTION]... [FILE]...
        
With no arguments, `du' reports the disk space for the current
directory.  Normally the disk space is printed in units of 1024 bytes,
but this can be overridden (*note Block size::).  Non-integer
quantities are rounded up to the next higher unit.

   If two or more hard links point to the same file, only one of the
hard links is counted.  The FILE argument order affects which links are
counted, and changing the argument order may change the numbers that
`du' outputs.

`-h'
`--human-readable'
     Append a size letter to each size, such as `M' for mebibytes.
     Powers of 1024 are used, not 1000; `M' stands for 1,048,576 bytes.
     This option is equivalent to `--block-size=human-readable'.  Use
     the `--si' option if you prefer powers of 1000.
